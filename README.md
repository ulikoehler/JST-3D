# JST-VH-3D

Unofficial JST VH 3D models (parametrically modeled in Fusion360).
Modeled after the official [datasheet](https://datasheet.lcsc.com/lcsc/2304140030_JST-Sales-America-B2P-VH-LF-SN_C160315.pdf) and my own 

### Why not use the official models?

JST provides some official models, for links see [this blogpost](https://techoverflow.net/2023/10/29/where-to-find-3d-models-for-jst-vh-connectors/). However, those models are a) not very detailed and b) they force you to agree to an EULA, including having to fill name & company details for every single model you use.

My goal with this series of 3D models is to provide liberally licensed (CC1.0 is as liberal as it gets :-) ) and parametric models so that anyone can freely adjust them to their needs.
Additionally, I want them to look at least realistic (even though some angles and measurements need to be estimated).
